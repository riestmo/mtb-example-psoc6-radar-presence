# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU : Human presence detection

## Overview
This code example demonstrates Infineon's radar presence solution to detect human presence within a configurable distance. Powered by the [XENSIV™ 60-GHz radar](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/radar-sensors/radar-sensors-for-iot/60ghz-radar/bgt60tr13c/), this solution provides extremely high accuracy in detecting both micro and macro motions. The ability to detect micro motion offers unique benefits over conventional technologies deployed to detect human presence, thus making it perfect for user interaction with devices.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. This document uses [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example will clone the "[Hello world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation


1. Mount radar wing board on the CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 kit and connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the [KitProg3](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-KitProg3_User_Guide-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f01221f1853)  COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


 <details><summary><b>For KIT-BGT60TR13C-EMBEDD</b></summary>

 1. To work with KIT-BGT60TR13C-EMBEDD, we need an external programmer, such as MiniProg4, that uses the SWD interface.
 
      **Figure 4. Cypress Mini Programmer**
 
      ![](images/miniprog4.png)

      To make the UART work properly on the Radar Embedded kit board, set the proper jumpers on the S3 and S5 switches.
      For the S3 switch, pins 1 and 2 must be closed and pins 3 and 4 must be opened.

      **Figure 5. Switch 3 Position**

      ![](images/s3_pins.png)

      For the S5 switch, pins 1 and 2 must be closed and pins 3 and 4 must be opened.
   
      **Figure 6. Switch 5 Position**

      ![](images/s5_pins.png)

      Connect KIT-BGT60TR13C-EMBEDD SWD interface with the programmer. Then, plug the USB cables for the board and for the programmer to power on both of them.

2. Open a terminal program and select a COM port where the board is connected (not the MiniProg4 port). Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:
   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute:

      ```
      make program TARGET=KIT-BGT60TR13C-EMBEDD TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

    </details>

</details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Presence application using XENSIV 60-GHz radar" is displayed on the UART terminal.

   **Figure 7. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/terminal-presence.png)

   **Table 1. Terminal output discription**
    | parameters  |  Event type  |  Description  |
   | ----------- | ----------- | -----    |
   | Radar State | macro presence  | Presence event detected.
   | Range bin  | 2 | maximum range bin 
   | Time stamp | '4298' | relative time in ms 
   
   **Note:**
   **Time Stamp** is relative to the boot time. This means when application first boot, the time counting starts from 0 ms.
   **Converstion of range bin to range in meters can be done by using following relation:**
    R (range in meters) = ( xensiv_radar_presence_get_bin_length() * config.max_range_bin )
   **eg: if xensiv_radar_presence_get_bin_length()=0.325**
   then **R=0.325 * 2 =0.66m**
   
5. Confirm that the kit LED blinks at approximately 1 Hz.

 The presence information is  provided either as macro or micro presence which can be seen either through prints on the terminal and also  the onboard LED turns red which indicates radar detected a target. And when the target leaves the detection zone, the terminal prints a absence message and LED turns green. 

### Sensor information and LEDs

1. For CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01, the radar task is suspended if the radar wing board is not connected to the feather kit. The sensor initialization process is indicated by blinking the red LED (CYBSP_USER_LED). The red LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) on CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 keeps blinking when the system is operational (ready state).
Please note that there is no user LED for KIT-BGT60TR13C-EMBEDD board.
 
2. The LED indicates different events with different colors as follows:

    **Table 2. Events and LED indication**

   | LED color  |  Event type  |  Description  |
   | ----------- | ----------- | -----    |
   | Red  | `XENSIV_RADAR_PRESENCE_STATE_MACRO_PRESENCE` | Presence event detected.
   | Red  | `XENSIV_RADAR_PRESENCE_STATE_MICRO_PRESENCE` | Presence event detected.
   | Green  | `XENSIV_RADAR_PRESENCE_STATE_ABSENCE ` | Absence event detected.

### Configuration parameters

You can configure the application parameters using the options provided on the terminal as follows:

1. Press 'enter' key to switch from work to settings mode.
2. Type help and press 'enter' key to see a list of configurable parameters as shown in the **Figure 8**.

    **Figure 8. Configuration mode**

    ![](images/configuration-mode.png)

   The complete list of configurable paramters with the valid values are shown in **Table 2**:

   **Table 3. Presence algortihm configuration parameters**

   | Key |  Default value  |  Valid Values  |
   | ----------- | ----------- | -----    |
   | set_max_range (m)| 2.0 | 0.66-5.0 | 
   | set_macro_threshold | 0.5 | 0.1-100.0 |
   | set_micro_threshold | 12.5 | 0.2-99.0 | 
   | bandpass_filter | disable | enable/disable|
   | decimation_filter | disable | enable/disable | 
   | set_mode | micro_if_macro | macro_only/micro_only/micro_if_macro/micro_and_macro |
   
   **Micro-motions**:
    Detecting small movements like fingure gestures or small headmovements in  a typical smart home environment for instance while working on lapop/keyboard.Micromotion also includes  detection of Stationary humans (normally breathing and blinking eyes) in sitting or standing positions (in line of sight).
   

   **Macro-motions**:
    Detecting major movements into or through the field of view.(Motion Detection).



   **Note**: Macro and Micro threshold parameters can be adjusted to achieve different levels of sensitivity.The  below table summarises three different levels (for instance high means  -solution being more sensitive to stationary peoples).
    
   **Table 4. Senstivity level with the corresponding threshold setting**
   | Sensitivity|Macro_threshold_value |Micro_threshold_value|
   | ----------- | ----------- | -----    
   | High| 0.5 | 12.5 |
   |Medium | 1.0 | 25 |
   | Low | 2.0 | 50 | 
   
   Note: The user have the provision to set any threshold values based on their use case requirement.
3. Type the command name with given value and press enter. If the parameter update is successful then 'ok' is displayed otherwise 'command not recognised' or 'invalid value' are printed.

For details, see the [XENSIV™ Radar Presence API Reference Guide](https://infineon.github.io/xensiv-radar-presence/html/index.html).

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings
This application uses a modular approach to build a presence application combining radar driver and presence algortihm library. The components used in this application are shown in **Figure 9**. 

**Figure 9. Application overview**

![](images/system-overview.png)

The radar configuration parameters are generated from a PC tool and saved in radar_settings.h, for more details please refer to [XENSIV™ BGT60TRxx Radar API Reference Guide](https://infineon.github.io/sensor-xensiv-bgt60trxx/html/index.html).
The user can also view the radar raw data and the presence library configuration parameters. After the initialization the application runs in an event driven way. The radar interrupt is used to notify to main task which then retrieves the radar data and provides it to the presence library.
